# LOWER Function
This function is used to lowercase text in a cell. Changing the letter case of your cell values can be beneficial when there are case inconsistencies among the cell inputs or when preparing your dataset for case-sensitive usage.
It is typed =LOWER
Insert example

# TRIM Function
This function is used to remove irregular text spacing and keep single spaces between words.

It is typed =TRIM
Insert example

# XOR Function
This function returns TRUE or FALSE based on two or more conditions.

It is typed =XOR

=XOR([logical1], [logical2], ...)

The conditions are referred to as [logical1], [logical2], and so on.
The conditions can check things like:
- If a number is greater than another number >
- If a number is smaller than another number <
- If a number or text is equal to something =

For two conditions, you can think of the XOR function as: "either this or that, but not both"
