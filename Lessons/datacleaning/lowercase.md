<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4"> Lower Function</h2>
This function is used to lowercase text in a cell. Changing the letter case of your cell values can be beneficial when there are case inconsistencies among the cell inputs or when preparing your dataset for case-sensitive usage.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4"> XOR Function</h2>
This function returns TRUE or FALSE based on two or more conditions.
<br>
It is typed =XOR
<br>
=XOR([logical1], [logical2], ...)

The conditions are referred to as [logical1], [logical2], and so on.
The conditions can check things like:
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
<li> If a number is greater than another number > </li>
<li> If a number is smaller than another number < </li>
<li> If a number or text is equal to something = </li>
</ul>
<br>
For two conditions, you can think of the XOR function as: "either this or that, but not both"

</div>
