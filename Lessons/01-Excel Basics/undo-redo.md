The Undo function allows you to reverse an action. This function is useful when you have made a mistake in your spreadsheet and want to go back to the way the spreadsheet looked before. <br><br>

<strong>Warning:</strong>You cannot undo actions such as deleting a sheet or sheet tab, saving a spreadsheet, or changing the options. You can only undo things inside your spreadsheet.  <br><br>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4">The Redo function</h2>
The redo function, on the other hand, reverses the Undo action. This is helpful when you regret using the undo function. To use the Redo function, press the button in the Ribbon. It should be placed directly under the Undo button. <br>

<strong>Tip:</strong> You can also use the keyboard shortcut, <strong>CTRL + Y/Command + Y</strong>
<br><br>
<strong>Warning:</strong>The Redo command is only available if you have used the Undo function.
