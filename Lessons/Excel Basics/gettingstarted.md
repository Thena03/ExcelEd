# Getting Started with Excel
Excel can be found in many different digital forms. This tutorial will describe the various ways you can access Excel.

## Learning Objectives 
- Downloading Excel 
- Accessing Excel through different platforms

## Microsoft Office 365
Microsoft Office 365 is the web version of Excel. It is the easiest way to access the program since it does not require any installation. This can be accessed through 
[Microsoft Office 365](https://www.office.com).


To access Excel on [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.office.com), first log in to your Microsoft account.

If you do not have a Microsoft account, please follow the quick and easy sign-up instructions on the website. Once you are logged in, click on the green spreadsheet icon on the left side to enter the application.

After entering the Excel application, click on the “New Blank workbook” button to open a new Excel spreadsheet. 

## Accessing Through the Mobile App
When you are on the go, the Excel mobile app allows you to view and edit your spreadsheet from your mobile device. The setup for the mobile app is simple. You will access your device’s app store and search for Microsoft Excel. Once you locate the Excel app, you will download the app as normal and then sign in to your Microsoft 365 account. 

After that, you are logged in and ready to work on your spreadsheet. 

## Accessing Through the Desktop App

While the browser version is the most common way Excel is used, it is limited in allowing users to use advanced Data Tools. For this reason, it may be beneficial to use the desktop version of Excel. The desktop app gives users full access to a range of formulas and functions, as well as the opportunity to work on their spreadsheet offline.

## Installing Desktop Application 

While subscriptions are necessary to access the desktop version of Excel, most colleges and universities allow students to have full access to Microsoft 365 apps (please check with your college or university before installing the desktop application). 

Once signed in, go to the homepage and click on “Install Apps” or Install Office” in the top right corner. From the dropdown menu, select “Microsoft 365 apps.” This will install all of the Microsoft 365 apps, including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, on your computer. Please follow the instructions given by the installer as it downloads (if applicable). 

**Tip:** Please note that you may be prompted to sign in again to activate the apps.
