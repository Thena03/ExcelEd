<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4">Colors</h2>
Excel has a set number of themes and standard colors that are available for users to use. Using a color for a cell is easy; just select a color by clicking on it.

The “More Colors” option allows you to select custom colors by entering a RGB or HEX code.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4">RGB Colors</h2>
RGB colors are colors specified with `rgb( RED, GREEN, BLUE). Each category defines the intensity of that color as an integer between 0 and 255. 

For instance, RGB (0, 255, 0) is green. 255 is the highest value, so that means that the cell would be set to be green.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4"> Hexadecimal Colors (HEX Codes)</h2>
A hexadecimal is a color specified with #RRGGBB. RR(red), GG (green), and BB (blue) are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF with FF displaying the highest intensity.

For instance, ##FF0000 is going to be displayed as red since red is set to the highest value and the other values are set to the lowest values.
