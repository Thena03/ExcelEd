<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4"> Net Present Value (NPV) Function</h2>
The NPV function calculates the Net Present Value of an investment using a discount rate and a series of future cash flows. The purpose of this function is to help decide whether an investment is positive in the future.
<br>
The syntax is:
<br>
= NPV(rate, value 1, value 2,...)
<br>
<strong>Rate</strong> = discount rate per period
<strong>Value1, value2… </strong> = series of cash flows occurring at the end of each period 
To use this function, use `=NPV`. 
<br>
Insert example
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> The NPV function discounts from the first period, so the initial investment must be added after the function to get the correct total.
