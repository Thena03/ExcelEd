# Net Present Value (NPV) Function 
The NPV function calculates the Net Present Value of an investment using a discount rate and a series of future cash flows. The purpose of this function is to help decide whether an investment is positive in the future.
The syntax is:

= NPV(rate, value 1, value 2,...)
Rate = discount rate per period
Value1, value2… = series of cash flows occurring at the end of each period 
To use this function, use `=NPV`. 

Insert example

**Note:** The NPV function discounts from the first period, so the initial investment must be added after the function to get the correct total.
