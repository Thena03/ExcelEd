<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4">Colors</h2>
Excel has a set number of themes and standard colors that are available for users to use. Using a color for a cell is easy; just select a color by clicking on it.
<br><br>
The “More Colors” option allows you to select custom colors by entering a RGB or HEX code.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4">RGB Colors</h2>
RGB colors are colors specified with <strong>rgb( <p style="color:red">RED </p>, <p style="color:green">GREEN</p>, <p style="color:blue">BLUE</p>)</strong>. Each category defines the intensity of that color as an integer between 0 and 255. 
<br><br>
For instance, RGB (0, 255, 0) is <p style="color:green">green</p>. 255 is the highest value, so that means that the cell would be set to be green.

<div class="bg-white border-l-4 border-green-600 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6 shadow-sm">
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4"> Hexadecimal Colors (HEX Codes)</h2>
A hexadecimal is a color specified with <strong>#RRGGBB</strong>. <p style="color:red">RR(red)</p>, <p style="color:green">GG (green)</p>, and <p style="color:blue">BB (blue)</p> are hexadecimal integers between 00 and FF with FF displaying the highest intensity.
<br><br>
For instance, ##FF0000 is going to be displayed as <p style="color:red">red</p>since <p style="color:red">red</p>is set to the highest value and the other values are set to the lowest values.
