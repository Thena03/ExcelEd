<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center mb-4"> Sort Functions</h2>
Cell values can be sorted using the Sort Ascending and Sort Descending commands.

Sort ascending sorts values from smallest to largest (or in alphabetical order for text values). Sort descending sorts values from largest to smallest (or in reverse alphabetical order for text values).
