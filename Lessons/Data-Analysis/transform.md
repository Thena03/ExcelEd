# Transforming Data in Excel

## Sort Functions
Cell values can be sorted using the Sort Ascending and Sort Descending commands.

Sort ascending sorts values from smallest to largest (or in alphabetical order for text values). Sort descending sorts values from largest to smallest (or in reverse alphabetical order for text values). 
Insert example

**Tip:** To sort a range with multiple columns, the entire range must be selected. Sorting only one column in a range will break the relationship between columns.

Insert example - error

## Filter Function
Filters can be applied to sort and hide data in a spreadsheet. To filter data in a spreadsheet, access the sort and filter menu in the Ribbon view. You can also access the filter through the Data section in the navigation bar.

Insert example

### Applying Filters
Filters can be applied by selecting a range and then clicking the Filter command. It is important that you have column headers when applying filters so that you know what data you are filtering. 

Filters are applied to the top row in a range.
